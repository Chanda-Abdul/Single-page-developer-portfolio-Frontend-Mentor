## The challenge

Users should be able to:

- [x] Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - [x] Any field is empty
  - [x] The email address is not formatted correctly
- [x] View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size:
  - [x] Mobile @ 375px
  - [x] Tablet @ 768px
  - [x] Desktop @ 1220px
- [x] See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- [ ] **Bonus**: Hook the form up so it sends and stores the user's enquiry (you can use a spreadsheet or Airtable to save the enquiries)
- [x] **Bonus**: Add your own details (image, skills, projects) to replace the ones in the design

## What I learned

<!-- Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

 -->


## Continued development
